# Molecular-Motion
Simulate the path of pollen grain on the surface of a water drop. A pollen grain floating on a drop of water moves across the surface of the water because it's constantly pushed around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is random.

Starting point is shown with larger red point and the yellow point represents the end of path.
